# MESMO 
## Modular Embedded Systems Management and Orchestration project




In the ever-evolving landscape of aerospace engineering and mission-critical operations, the MESMO (Modular Embedded Systems framework for Mission Operations) project stands as a robust and adaptable solution designed to address the complexities of orchestrating a multitude of subsystems. In the pursuit of streamlined communication, MESMO leverages the \textit{Fâ€™} (pronounced \textit{f prime}) software framework, a modular and scalable framework tailored for the harsh demands of space missions.

The Objective of this project is to study in depth the \textit{F'} framework and assess whether it could be used for real time embedded systems orchestration and management for ground applications. To do so, the MESMO project combines a diverse array of hardware components collaborates coherently, creating an integrated ecosystem. Arduino-based microcontrollers, GPS modules, imaging systems, and other specialized devices work in unison, forming a network orchestrated by a Raspberry Pi 4. This central processing unit serves as the nucleus, communicating with each subsystem through a combination of UART, I2C, and TCP protocols.

To comprehensively assess the MESMO project's performance and communication efficiency, a meticulously crafted testbench has been implemented. This testbench analysis various scenarios and subsystem configurations, particularly focusing on the time elapsed from message reception to command execution.

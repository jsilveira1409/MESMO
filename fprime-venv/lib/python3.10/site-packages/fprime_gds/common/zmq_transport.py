""" fprime_gds.common.zmq_transport:

A set of implementations based on ZeroMQ for data passing amongst components in the fprime_gds. ZeroMQ was chose to
replace the ThreadedTcpServer for several reasons as described below.

1. ZeroMQ is performant and can move 1GB/s/thread
2. ZeroMQ does not require a separate process and may be used w/o tcp sockets
3. ZeroMQ will not reorder packets at high data rates

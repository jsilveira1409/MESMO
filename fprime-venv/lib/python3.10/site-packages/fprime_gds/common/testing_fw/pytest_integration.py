""" pytest_integration.py: F´ fixture API fixture

pytest uses fixtures to provide for extra functionality when writing tests. This fixture sets up the F´ stack allowing
our tests to use a configured test API without needing to create any specific setup to use that API. i.e. write a test
as follows:

```python
def test_my_test(fprime_test_api):
    ''' Perform my test '''
    fprime_test_api.send_and_assert_command(...)
```

Here a test (defined by starting the name with test_) uses the fprime_test_api fixture to perform the test.

    strip those from the standard cli processing. Long options must be supplied when testing using pytest.

      1. APIs all use one connection to the GDS
      2. APIs and the connections are live across the whole pytest session. See fprime_test_api.

    from pytest documentation.

fprime_gds.common.transport:

Sets up the classes used to transport data within the GDS system between the few executables that compose the GDS. This
file defines several base classes used to specify what a client looks like and it defines a basic implementation:
ThreadedTCPSocketClient used to send data through the threaded tcp server.

fprime.util.build_helper.py

This script is defined to help users run standard make processes using CMake. This will support migrants from the old
make system, as well as enable more efficient practices when developing in the CMake system. The following functions
are supported herein:

 - build: build the current directory/module/deployment
 - impl: make implementation templates
 - testimpl: make testing templates
 - build_ut: build the current UTs
 - check: run modules unit tests

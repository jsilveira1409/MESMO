# {{cookiecutter.deployment_name}} Application

This deployment was auto-generated by the F' utility tool.

## Building and Running the {{cookiecutter.deployment_name}} Application

In order to build the {{cookiecutter.deployment_name}} application, or any other FÂ´ application, we first need to generate a build directory. This can be done with the following commands:

```
cd {{cookiecutter.deployment_name}}
fprime-util generate
```

The next step is to build the {{cookiecutter.deployment_name}} application's code.
```
fprime-util build
```

## Running the application and F' GDS

The following command will spin up the F' GDS as well as run the application binary and the components necessary for the GDS and application to communicate.

```
cd {{cookiecutter.deployment_name}}
fprime-gds
```

To run the ground system without starting the {{cookiecutter.deployment_name}} app:
```
cd {{cookiecutter.deployment_name}}
fprime-gds --no-app
```

The application binary may then be run independently from the created 'bin' directory.

```
cd {{cookiecutter.deployment_name}}/build-artifacts/<platform>/bin/
./{{cookiecutter.deployment_name}} -a 127.0.0.1 -p 50000
```
